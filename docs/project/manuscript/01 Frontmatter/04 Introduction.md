# Introduction

A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) is not just a game but a collaborative storytelling experience where players create and share memorable adventures. Bringing together two or more players, either around a physical or digital table, TTRPGs allow participants to take on the roles of characters in a fictional setting, much like a novel, TV series, or movie. They build a shared narrative that fosters imagination, teamwork, and a sense of community.

## The Game

The ***Dungeon Legacy*** RPG is a tabletop adventure ruleset, a rules-lite roleplaying game designed for storytelling, danger, and action flow—a return to non-tactical, theatre-of-the-mind gameplay. Adventures in *Dungeon Legacy* is written in an Old-School Renaissance (OSR) style, so it plays fast and loose with less emphasis on the rules and more on rulings, a.k.a. rules as intended. Although maps and miniatures can be used, most game aids are minimal. However, unlike other OSR games, the game mechanics of *Dungeon Legacy* are kept basic but subtly clever, allowing for more character options, equipment, and supplemental rules to augment gameplay.

*Dungeon Legacy* is perfect for players who thrive on creative freedom and fast-paced storytelling, where imagination and quick thinking are essential. Whether you're a seasoned roleplayer looking for streamlined mechanics or new to tabletop gaming and eager for a more narrative-focused experience, *Dungeon Legacy* offers a flexible toolkit that adapts to your style. This game shines in groups that prioritize story immersion, improvisation, and character-driven adventures over complex tactical systems. Additionally, *Dungeon Legacy* is highly customizable and designed to be a toolkit for your imagination, enabling you to add your flavors and houserules to expand the game further.

> ***Theatre-of-the-Mind.*** This style of play is where everything in-game is wholly imagined, taking place in the players' minds, and is at the heart of *Dungeon Legacy*. Here, the group can experience interactive adventures through the back-and-forth storytelling between the gamemaster and the players. Many modern rulesets rely on tactical rules that get in the way, bogging the game down by interfering with its flow. These games use plotted landscapes, or virtual tabletops (VTTs), that are excessively tactical; it's like playing a video game in slow motion. Theatre-of-the-mind is non-tactical and allows players and gamemasters to describe actions in quick detail without worrying about the tactical rules. Although handouts, maps, and basic miniature placement can be used, theatre-of-the-mind allows gaming groups to concentrate more on the storylines, descriptions, and characterizations. This provides an opportunity to visualize and respond to everything in more detail and less time, allowing for more productive and enjoyable game sessions. In addition, the gamemaster will spend less time preparing the tools of the trade for each adventure. Many consider this mind’s eye approach the quintessential gaming style.

## Game Crew

A tabletop roleplaying game consists of a group of players, usually 2 to 8, where one player takes on the role of gamemaster.

The ***players*** roleplay the **heroes**—a.k.a. player characters (PCs)—the protagonists striving to survive and thrive in their adventures. Players make decisions for their characters, shaping the story through their choices, and roll dice to determine the success of their actions, per the gamemaster's guidance.

The ***gamemaster (GM)*** directs the **villains**—a.k.a. non-player characters (NPCs)—the antagonists that oppose the heroes. This includes all monsters, pedestrians, samaritans, and powers-that-be (good or bad). The gamemaster's job is to outline and run the adventure by narrating the story and overseeing the game's flow. In *Dungeon Legacy*, the gamemaster rarely makes dice rolls. Instead, players roll the dice to resolve their characters' actions, attacks, and defense rolls. This process allows the gamemaster to concentrate on the narrative elements, ensuring the adventure is engaging and fun for everyone involved.

### Gaming Etiquette

It's everyone's job to create an atmosphere of fun. Together, the gamemaster and the players co-write the ongoing storyline from each person's - or character's - point of view. The gamemaster may need to adjust his plots and arbitrate the ruleset as required but should never be the controlling entity of the whole storyline; instead, the story is continually generated - moment to moment - from the minds of the gamemaster, the players, and the results of each dice roll. The gamemaster should never railroad the game but rather allow it to evolve naturally from everyone's effort.

> ***Prime Directive.*** It's worth noting that the gamemaster has the final say over ANY rule or in-game situation. If the GM wishes to make a judgment call, change, or houserule anything in the game - on the spot - that's the GM's purview. However, it's always best to discuss any homebrewed changes before playing. Also, before starting a game for the first time, the gamemaster and the players should set any expectations they feel are essential; a good "Session Zero" - typically used to create characters - can also be used this way. Always respect each other and pause the game when issues arise. Discuss what is happening and adjust before proceeding. Nuff Said.

## Game Modes

There are several modes of play available within the game.

***Crew Play.*** This is the primary method of gameplay, consisting of a group of players and a gamemaster. One-on-one play also falls under this mode, and this ruleset reflects that as the default method of play.

***Solo Play.*** In this mode, a single player takes on both roles of player and gamemaster, using the `Dungeon Legacy Solo Ruleset`, which includes a tableless oracle to guide the narrative.

***Coop Play.*** This mode allows a group of players to play without a gamemaster. The players collaborate to tell the story, using as much or as little of the solo play ruleset as needed to handle narrative and game mechanics.

## Game Sessions

The ***adventures*** are governed and often created by the gamemaster. Short adventures, referred to as one-shots or side quests, can take hours or days to play, spanning multiple sessions. Longer adventures can last for weeks or months. A traditional adventure is a self-contained quest with a clear goal, though it can also be episodic, unfolding across multiple scenarios. Adventures can span various locations, from cities to dungeons, and even traverse countless worlds, planes, dimensions, and timelines, each offering unique challenges. Beyond being fun to play, adventures drive player character development—characters improve in their chosen skills and abilities as they gain experience.

The ***campaigns*** are a series of interconnected adventures, usually tied together by an overarching plot or hook that moves the player characters toward an ultimate goal, often leading to a final confrontation. Campaigns can last for months or even years, with players pausing and revisiting them across many sessions, and can even involve generations of characters. Campaigns may also be run and developed by multiple gamemasters, who can alternate between adventures or collaborate to share responsibilities in creating an ongoing, immersive narrative.

## Game Materials

A few supplies are needed to use this ruleset, which can be physical, digital, or a combination. Typically, a playgroup will draw maps, take notes, and track their characters' stats; see `Appendix XX` or our official website for various game aids and sheets. Additionally, each player will need a set of gaming dice. The gamemaster should outline any material requirements or restrictions before the game begins, such as whether digital or printed tools are preferred.

## Game Dice

This ruleset uses polyhedral gaming dice to validate a character’s actions and to resolve random events. A set of dice will typically include a 4-sided die (d4), 6-sided die (d6), 8-sided die (d8), 10-sided die (d10), 12-sided die (d12), 20-sided die (d20), and percentile dice (d100). The rules and the gamemaster will determine which dice to roll in any given situation.

***Percentile Dice (d100).*** Percentile dice consist of two 10-sided dice of different colors or styles. One die represents the "tens" place, and the other represents the "ones" place, designated before rolling. When rolled together, these dice generate a result of between 01% and 99%. A roll of "00" (double zeros) equals 100%.

***Dice Expressions.*** When rolling multiples of the same die type (dice pools), the number of dice to roll will be shown before the die type. For example, three 6-sided dice are written as *3d6*. Unless otherwise stated, dice pools are tallied for a final result.

***Dice Modifiers.*** A dice expression may include modifiers, such as *1d20+1* or *2d6x2*, where the roll result is calculated and adjusted per the formula.

***Always Round Down.*** Unless specified otherwise in the rules, any division or multiplication of numbers will always be rounded down, no matter the fraction, with a minimum result of 1.

### Advantage / Disadvantage

In the rules of the game, or when the gamemaster deems it appropriate, there are instances where characters gain an advantage or disadvantage based on the action or situation. These effects are usually applied to the action check but may also apply to any single die roll or even multiple dice (dice pools).

***Advantage (ADV)*** improves the odds by adding an extra die to the roll and using the best result, discarding the worst. For percentile dice, advantage allows the player to swap the dice positions (ones and tens) after the roll to achieve the best outcome.

***Disadvantage (DIS)*** worsens the odds by adding an extra die to the roll and, using the worst result, discarding the best. For percentile dice, disadvantage allows the player to swap the dice positions (ones and tens) after the roll to achieve the worst outcome.

## Conventions

These conventions are customarily practiced throughout the ruleset.

***Creatures.*** This term is synonymous with characters, monsters, and other beings, including heroes, player characters (PCs), villains, non-player characters (NPCs), animals, beasts, deities, or other powerful entities.

***Specific Beats General.*** Some rules may break or contradict others. More specific rules typically override general ones in such cases, but the gamemaster will arbitrate as needed.

***Always Round Down.*** Unless specified otherwise in the rules, any division of a number always rounds down, no matter the fraction, with a minimum result of 1.

***Terminology.*** Terms are used with specific meanings throughout this ruleset and are defined within the text. If a term is used but not immediately defined, check the `Index or Glossary` at the back of the material for clarification. Abbreviations will appear in parentheses the first time a term is introduced.
