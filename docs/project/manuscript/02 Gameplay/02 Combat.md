# Combat

`COPY NEEDED HERE`

## Distance

***Self.*** Yourself; some magic occurs here.
***Close.*** You're close if you're a few steps away; melee occurs here.
***Nearby.*** You're nearby if you're a short move away; throwing occurs here.
***Distant.*** You're distant if you're a long move away; shooting occurs here.
***Remote.*** You're remote if you're beyond distant; some magic occurs here.

## Initiative

This process determines who takes their turn first. In *Dungeon Legacy*, initiative is not determined by a dice roll but follows a natural order determined by a combination of factors. The goal is to maintain a dynamic, cinematic flow to scenes where characters act based on the context of the situation. Unless they have the surprise or benefit of reach or range, opponents who meet each other in combat act simultaneously at the moment.

### Surprise Factors

Preparedness plays a crucial role in determining who acts first in a scene. 

• ***Prepared Characters.*** Those who have the surprise or have an instant or readied action almost always go first. Similarly, characters who have held their actions (based on specific triggers) gain the initiative when their trigger is activated.
• ***Surprised Characters.*** Any character or enemy caught unaware acts last.

>**Example:** Characters waiting in ambush gains initiative over enemies when they spring their trap. Similarly, if a character holds an action until a door opens, gain initiative when the door is triggered.

### Range Factors

Unless surprised, characters with reach or range will always act first.

• ***Ranged Before Melee.*** Characters with ranged weapons or effects act before those in melee combat.
• ***Benefit of Reach.*** Characters with extended reach, with spears and polearms or large-sized creatures, act before those without the benefit of extended reach unless they are flanking or hidden from view.

>**Example:** Characters may fire their ranged weapons before their opponents can engage in melee range. Also, a giant with an extended reach swings its club before a smaller-sized character can get close.

### Momentum

Momentum often shifts between players and enemies, allowing for a fluid exchange of actions.

• ***Player Momentum.*** When a player character successfully resolves an action (such as an attack or defense), they may gain momentum if they have remaining action dice, allowing them to act again. However, momentum shifts back to the enemy if they `fail` or are interrupted.
• ***Narrative Momentum.*** The gamemaster may shift momentum based on the narrative flow. A significant event, such as a dramatic moment in combat, can shift momentum to a player or enemy.

>**Example:** A character successfully defends against an enemy’s attack, but the character has leftover action dice, thus activating momentum and delivering a counterattack immediately.

## Damage

Each weapon or attack type has a base damage. The difference between the result of the attack/defense check and the target number modifies this base damage.

* ***If the Check Exceeds the TN.*** Add the difference to the damage.
* ***If the Check Matches the TN.*** Use the damage as is.
* ***If the Check Is Below the TN.*** Subtract the difference from the damage.

**Example**: A warrior swings a sword with a Damage 4. The target number to hit an enemy is 15 (10+5 Defense rating). The warrior rolls a 17. The difference between the roll and the target number is +2, so the total damage is 6 (base damage of 4+2). If the warrior had rolled a 13, the total damage would be 2 (base damage of 4-2).
