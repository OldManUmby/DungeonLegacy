# Gameplay

## Scenes

A gameplay session is played out in scenes. A scene represents a particular snippet where various activities occur within the adventure. Scenes can take minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months to complete, as determined by the gamemaster. It isn't always necessary to track time exactly, although there are instances where this may occur. Scenes fall into three broad phases.

* ***Exploration.*** These activities consist of traveling the world, exploring environments, and interacting with objects. This may also include the accumulation of wealth and power.
* ***Encounter.*** These activities consist of interacting with factions, characters, or other beings. This can also include attacking, defending, and evading opponents.
* ***Downtime.*** These activities occur between adventures, like carousing, research, training, and other non-adventuring tasks. This can also include crafting and domain-level play.

## Turns

Once the gamemaster sets the scene, it may be necessary to partition the scene to give everyone a turn. Each turn takes approximately 6 seconds of in-game time to complete. During a turn, a character may perform various actions, an exception being any `condition` that prevents a character from acting. A round is the time it takes for everyone to complete a turn; once finalized, the next round begins. This process continues until the scene is concluded.

## Checks

### Action Check

During gameplay, characters may attempt numerous actions. While many actions are routine and effortless, some are contested or difficult; in such cases, an *action check* is called to validate each instance.

The character's ability score sets the target number for the check; a player must roll ***below*** it on a d20.

For all actions, the DC (see below) is determined using the key ability for the action, typically STR for melee attacks, DEX for ranged attacks, and a range of abilities for skill use. The lower the DC, the more demanding the action.

***Defense Class (DC).*** Used to determine the target number for combat actions, like melee and ranged attacks. The defense class of a character or monster equals the attacker's STR or DEX minus the opposition's level. The higher the level, the lower the DC.

***Difficulty Class (DC).*** Used to determine the target number for non-combat actions, like ability checks and skill use. The difficulty class of an action equals the appropriate character's ability score minus the difficulty level. The higher the level, the lower the DC.

### Reaction Check

Monsters don't make checks; a character must evade their attacks by making a reaction check.

## Distances

***Self.*** XX

***Reach.*** You're within reach if you are a few steps away. Fighting occurs within reach (approx. 10').

***Close.*** You're close if you are only a move action away. 

***Near.*** XX

***Distant.*** XX

***Remote.*** XX
