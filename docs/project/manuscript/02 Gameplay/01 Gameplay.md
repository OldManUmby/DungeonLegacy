# Gameplay

During gameplay, characters may attempt numerous actions. While many actions are routine and effortless, some are unfavorable or under threat of failure; in these cases, a _check_ is called to validate each action.

## Action Checks

There are two types of action checks: _contested_ and _non-contested_.

***Contested Check.*** The character's ability score sets the target number for the check; a player must roll _**below**_ it on a d20.

***Non-Contested Check.*** The character's ability score sets the target number for the check; a player must roll _**below**_ it on a d20.

## Reaction Checks

Monsters don't make checks; a character must evade their attacks by making a reaction check.
