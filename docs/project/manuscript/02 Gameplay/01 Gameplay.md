## Turns

As the game progresses, each player and the gamemaster get to take action on their turn, with only a few exceptions, being a `condition` that prevents a character from taking action.

There are several types of turns.

* ***Moments.*** Turns used during fast-paced segments, like combat or chases. Moments are typically 1-6 seconds in length.
 * ***Scenes.*** Turns used during easy-paced segments, like adventuring and exploring.

The gamemaster may advance to any type of turn as needed, substituting **Minutes** for **Hours**, **Days**, or even **Months** should the adventure require it.

## Checks

### Action Check

During gameplay, characters may attempt numerous actions. While many actions are routine and effortless, some are contested or difficult; in such cases, an *action check* is called to validate each instance.

The character's ability score sets the target number for the check; a player must roll ***below*** it on a d20.

For all actions, the DC (see below) is determined using the key ability for the action, typically STR for melee attacks, DEX for ranged attacks, and a range of abilities for skill use. The lower the DC, the more demanding the action.

***Defense Class (DC).*** Used to determine the target number for combat actions, like melee and ranged attacks. The defense class of a character or monster equals the attacker's STR or DEX minus the opposition's level. The higher the level, the lower the DC.

***Difficulty Class (DC).*** Used to determine the target number for non-combat actions, like ability checks and skill use. The difficulty class of an action equals the appropriate character's ability score minus the difficulty level. The higher the level, the lower the DC.

### Reaction Check

Monsters don't make checks; a character must evade their attacks by making a reaction check.
