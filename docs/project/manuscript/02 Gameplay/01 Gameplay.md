## Scenes

A gameplay session is played out in scenes. A scene represents a particular snippet where various activities occur within the adventure. Scenes fall into three broad phases.

* ***Exploration.*** These activities consist of traveling the world, exploring environments, and interacting with objects. This often leads to the accumulation of wealth and power.
* ***Encounter.*** These activities consist of interacting with factions, characters, or other beings. This can also include attacking, defending, and evading opponents.
* ***Downtime.*** These activities occur between adventures, like carousing, research, training, and other non-adventuring tasks. This can also include crafting and domain-level play.

Scenes can take minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months to complete, as determined by the gamemaster. It isn't necessary to always track time, although there are instances where giving everyone a more defined turn is necessary, particularly during combat encounters.

## Turns

Once the gamemaster sets the scene, it may be necessary to partition it and give everyone a turn. During a turn, a character may perform various actions, an exception being any `condition` that prevents a character from acting. Each turn takes approximately 6 seconds of in-game time to complete. A round is when everyone completes a single turn; the next round begins once all turns are finalized. This process continues until the scene is concluded.

## Actions

During gameplay, characters may attempt numerous actions; while many are routine and effortless, some are contested or difficult. In such cases, an *action check* or *reaction check* is called to validate each instance. A check is performed by rolling the d20 and comparing the result against the DC. The action is successful if the roll is equal to or under the DC. The action has failed if the roll is above the DC.

### Action Check

The DC (see below) is determined using the appropriate ability for all actions.

***Defense Class (DC).*** Used to determine the target number for combat actions, like melee and ranged attacks. The defense class of a character or monster equals the attacker's STR or DEX minus the opposition's level. The higher the level, the lower the DC.

***Difficulty Class (DC).*** Used to determine the target number for non-combat actions, like ability checks and skill use. The difficulty class of an action equals the appropriate character's ability score minus the difficulty level. The higher the level, the lower the DC.

### Reaction Check

Monsters don't make checks; a character must evade their attacks by making a reaction check.

## Distances

***Self.*** XX

***Reach.*** You're within reach if you are a few steps away. Fighting occurs within reach (approx. 10').

***Close.*** You're close if you are only a move action away. 

***Near.*** XX

***Distant.*** XX

***Remote.*** XX
