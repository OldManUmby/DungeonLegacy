### Action Check

During gameplay, characters may attempt numerous actions. While many actions are routine and effortless, some are contested or challenging; in these cases, an *action check* is called to validate each action.

There are two types of action checks: *contested* and *non-contested*.

***Contested Check.*** The character's ability score sets the target number for the check; a player must roll ***below*** it on a d20.

***Non-Contested Check.*** The character's ability score sets the target number for the check; a player must roll ***below*** it on a d20.

### Reaction Check

Monsters don't make checks; a character must evade their attacks by making a reaction check.
