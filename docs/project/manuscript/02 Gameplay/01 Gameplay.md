# Gameplay

## Scenes

A game session is played in scenes that fall into three broad states.

***Adventuring.*** Activities like delving, exploring, investigating, examining, and traveling.
***Encounters.*** Activities like fighting or interacting with characters, monsters, and other beings.
***Downtime.*** Activities that occur while not adventuring, like carousing, crafting, research, and training.

Some activities may overlap states; for example, traveling could be considered an adventuring or downtime activity, depending on its context.

The gamemaster sets each scene and manages the transition from one to another, often as part of the adventure or plot or by responding to player cues. Transitions can happen seamlessly or dramatically, depending on the situation, keeping the flow of the narrative dynamic.

## Turns

Once the gamemaster sets the scene, it may be necessary to grant each character a turn to resolve their actions. The turn length is adaptable to fit the narrative or gameplay situation as needed. Most actions co-occur in an open and fluid manner. Some actions, such as long-term tasks or ongoing effects, may carry over into the character's next turn (or longer). This process continues, turn after turn, until all the characters' actions are resolved and the scene is concluded.

During encounters, there is no fixed period for a character's turn; instead, they occur at the moment, taking mere seconds to complete. In other scenes, however, a turn may take minutes, hours, days, or longer to finalize, depending on the nature of the activity and the gamemasterâ€™s judgment.

## Actions

Some character actions are routine and effortless, while others are contested or pose a more significant challenge; during such instances, a check is called to validate each action.

### Action Checks

All action checks are performed by rolling a d20 at or above a Target Number (TN). The higher the roll, the better the outcome. Rolling a 1 is always a failure, while a 20 is most often a success. Target numbers are derived based on the type of action taken.

* ***For Attack Actions.*** TN = 10 + Defense rating of the opponent.
* ***For Defence Actions.*** TN = 10 + Attack rating of the opponent.
* ***For Contested Actions.*** TN = 10 + Trait level of the opponent.
* ***For Uncontested Actions.*** TN = 10 + Risk level set by the GM.

### Action Pools

To represent the unique strengths of each character class, characters are granted a pool of action dice to add to the appropriate checks based on their class and action taken.

* ***Grit Dice.*** Used by warriors to enhance combat actions.
* ***Luck Dice.*** Used by rogues to boost daring and stealthy actions.
* ***Mana Dice.*** Used by mages to power arcane actions and spells.
* ***Hope Dice.*** Used by priests to amplify divine actions and prayers.
* ***Glam Dice.*** Used by the fey to perform otherworldly actions.
* ***Bane Dice*** Used by boss villains to perform heinous acts.

**Example**: A rogue attempts to stab a creature with a dagger with a Damage 2. The TN is 12 (10 + 2 Defense rating of the creature). The player rolls a d20 and adds 1 Luck Die. The dice tally to 15, meaning the difference (+3) increases the damage to 5 (damage 2 + 3).
