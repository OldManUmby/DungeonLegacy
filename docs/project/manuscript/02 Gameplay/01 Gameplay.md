# Gameplay

The are several modes of gameplay available to players.

***Group Play*** is the typical method of gameplay consisting of at least one player and a gamemaster, although many more players are common. These rules default to this method of play.

***Coop Play*** is like group play but without a gamemaster. Here the players share the responsibility of the gamemaster using much of the solo play ruleset.

***Solo Play*** is where a single player also acts as a gamemaster using the *Dungeon Legacy Solo Ruleset*.

During gameplay, characters may attempt numerous actions. While many actions are routine and effortless, some are unfavorable or under threat of failure; in these cases, a _check_ is called to validate each action.
## Action Checks

There are two types of action checks: _contested_ and _non-contested_.

***Contested Check.*** The character's ability score sets the target number for the check; a player must roll _**below**_ it on a d20.

***Non-Contested Check.*** The character's ability score sets the target number for the check; a player must roll _**below**_ it on a d20.
## Reaction Checks

Monsters don't make checks; a character must evade their attacks by making a reaction check.
