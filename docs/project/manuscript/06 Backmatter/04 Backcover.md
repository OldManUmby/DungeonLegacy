The ***Dungeon Legacy*** RPG is a rules-lite tabletop roleplaying game designed for storytelling, danger, and action flow, a return to non-tactical, theatre-of-the-mind gameplay. Adventures in *Dungeon Legacy* is written in an Old-School Renaissance (OSR) style, so it plays fast and loose - rules as intended - and although maps and miniatures can be used, most game aids are minimal. However, unlike other OSR games, *Dungeon Legacy* still allows for a sundry of character options, supplemental rules, and tons of gear. Also, *Dungeon Legacy* is highly customizable; add your flavors and houserules to expand the game further.
