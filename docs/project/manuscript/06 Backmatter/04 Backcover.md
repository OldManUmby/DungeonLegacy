The ***Dungeon Legacy*** RPG is a tabletop adventure ruleset, a rules-lite roleplaying game designed for storytelling, danger, and action flowâ€”a return to non-tactical, theatre-of-the-mind gameplay. Adventures in *Dungeon Legacy* is written in an Old-School Renaissance (OSR) style, so it plays fast and loose with less emphasis on the rules and more on rulings, a.k.a. rules as intended. Although maps and miniatures can be used, most game aids are minimal. However, unlike other OSR games, the game mechanics of *Dungeon Legacy* are kept basic but subtly clever, allowing for more character options, equipment, and supplemental rules to augment gameplay.

*Dungeon Legacy* is perfect for players who thrive on creative freedom and fast-paced storytelling, where imagination and quick thinking are essential. Whether you're a seasoned roleplayer looking for streamlined mechanics or new to tabletop gaming and eager for a more narrative-focused experience, *Dungeon Legacy* offers a flexible toolkit that adapts to your style. This game shines in groups that prioritize story immersion, improvisation, and character-driven adventures over complex tactical systems. Additionally, *Dungeon Legacy* is highly customizable and designed to be a toolkit for your imagination, enabling you to add your flavors and houserules to expand the game further.
